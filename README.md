# Pixelchains

Pixelchains is a game inspired by Chainz game series.

How to use the code:
1. Download the source code of the game. Unzip it and remember its location.
2. Download Godot from https://godotengine.org/ (minimum version required: 3.0.6).
3. Open Godot and click "Import" button.
4. Navigate to the folder with the source code and select `project.godot` file.
5. If all steps were done properly, you should be able to run the game pressing F5 button.

If do you want to contribute, I advise you to learn Godot first, especially GDScript: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html
The documentation isn't done yet.
